# Movies analysis - Statistical project

## Project Overview

The objective of this project, conducted as part of academic studies, is to explore and analyze key features of the dataset including the Year of Release, Duration in Minutes, and Rating on a Scale of 1-10. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, visualizations, and hypothesis testing using the R programming language.

The data used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and comprises information about American movies released between 1915 and 2023. The dataset can be accessed at: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/10000-data-about-movies-1915-2023/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/10000-data-about-movies-1915-2023/data).

## Analysis Highlights

### Data Preparation
Extracted three main columns from the dataset: Year of Release, Duration in Minutes and Rating.

### Statistical Analysis
Computed descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, variance and more for each feature.

### Visualisations
Investigated distributions, tendencies and variability using graphical methods like histograms, density plots, ECDF plots, box plots and scatter plots.

### Statistical Hypothesis Testing
Tested hypotheses concerning the mean rating of films, correlation between release year and duration, and variance ratio of duration to release year.

### R Environment Functions Used
Utilized various functions from R packages including utils, base, stats and graphics for data manipulation, statistical calculations and plotting.

## Conclusion
This project provides a detailed exploration of statistical techniques applied to movie data, offering insights into trends, distributions, and relationships among key variables. The findings are crucial for understanding patterns in American cinema over the past century.
